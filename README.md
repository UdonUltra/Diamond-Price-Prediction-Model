    <h1><b>Predicting Diamond Price</b></h1>
   <br>
    <p>The goal of this project is to create machine learning model to predict diamonds price based on its 4C (Cut, Color, Clarity, and Carat) and any other descriptions by testing several models such as KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and xgboost. </p>

## 📝 **Problem Background**
Pricing diamonds need set of skills to appreciate and scoring their physical traits. This could cost money as you need to pay skilled human resources. With using Machine learning model, we could try to predict diamond prices without relying on human resources. 

---
## 🎯 **Objective**
My goal is to test several machine learning models. After evaluating base models, I will tune hyperparameter to improve base models that have better performances.

---
## 🚀 **Deployment & Dashboard**
We deployed our analysis result and predictor model on the web.
